Usage: sqlite3_pb_ext_gen [OPTION] PROTO_FILES
dependencies: protoc
Parse PROTO_FILES and generate output based on the options given:
  -v, --version               Show sqlite3_pb_ext version and exit.
  -h, --help                  Show this text and exit.
  -oPATH, --out_path=PATH     Generated SQLite3 Protobuf extension path.
  -IPATH, --proto_path=PATH   Specify the directory in which to search for
                              imports.  May be specified multiple times;
                              directories will be searched in order.  If not
                              given, the current working directory is used.
                              If not found in any of the these directories,
                              the --descriptor_set_in descriptors will be
                              checked for required proto file.
  @<filename>                 Read options and filenames from file. If a
                              relative file path is specified, the file will
                              be searched in the working directory.
                              The --proto_path option will not affect how this
                              argument file is searched. Content of the file
                              will be expanded in the position of @<filename>
                              as in the argument list. Note that shell 
                              expansion is not applied to the content of the 
                              file (i.e., you cannot use quotes, wildcards,
                              escapes, commands, etc.). Each line corresponds
                              to a single argument, even if it contains spaces.
